## Witcher is?
   A witcher (Polish: wiedźmin) also known as a wiccan, hexer, vedymin, or witchman (Elder Speech: vatt'ghern), is someone who has undergone extensive training, ruthless mental and physical conditioning, and mysterious rituals (which take place at "witcher schools" such as Kaer Morhen) in preparation for becoming an itinerant monster slayer for hire. Geralt, the central character in Andrzej Sapkowski's Witcher series and the subsequent games inspired by them, is said in the stories to be one of the greatest witchers; he is certainly legendary, but whether famous or infamous is more open to interpretation (and/or subject to gameplay, as the case may be).

## Why witcher 3 is so good?
**Graphics:**

Graphics don’t make a game, but they certainly don’t hurt it. The incredible graphics, sunshine and style is in sync with the game, making it feel as though you are in the universe. The placement of props really brings you into the game as you see the world as it is rather than a pale reflection.

**Weapons:**

Most games have a plethora of weapons, while the Witcher 3 is limited only to a sword, a silver sword, a crossbow and magic - And even a limited selection of magic. This seems like a bad thing - more weapon types are good, right? But in fact, this forces you into the style of the Witcher, and you become expert in this fighting style. It also puts an even ground as there is no such thing as a worse weapon type - each caters to it’s own enemy. You become less concerned with your weapons and more so with your fighting ability.

**Open World:**

It is far from the first to do it, but it does it one of the best. Instead of one giant open world, it has smaller ones representing different locations. This seems bad, but in fact it shows how big the world is - if you spend ages trying to get somewhere that’s only a cm away on the map, it must be big. It was well made so you rarely if ever reach the edge of the map, and is giant such that anywhere you go will find a cave, enemies or something. And this is all in one map rather than seperated by loading screens. You can immediately go anywhere, but are limited instead by whether your level is high enough to defeat enemies you find there. On that…

**Levels:**

Like many games, The Witcher 3 uses a level system. This mostly works as enemies do NOT scale, so you’re encouraged to level up before chasing certain quests, keeping the story advancing too fast.

**Enemies:**

The enemies in the game are amazing. There are a set number of specific monsters, all based off the series. They all have specific weaknesses, encouuraging you to vary your magic, oil and bombs depending on the enemy. Some need to be trapped in order to defeat, while others you just have to keep dodging because any one hit will bring you down. The variety of enemies keeps it fun, needing to continually vary strategy.

**Fighting:**

Swordplay is done incredibly in the game. It’s simple - left click to strike, right click to block, but gives bonuses for timing. More importantly, you can roll and dodge. While most games have you clicking as quick as possible to hit the enemy, this becomes more of a dance, and is much more realistic. Instead of taking hits, you dodge. Hit, dodge, hit dodge. This makes even hard fights more manageable as you can defend simply by not getting hit. Along with the crossbow for flying and underwater, and bombs, fighting becomes very enjoyable.

**Magic:**

Magic signs are also a great part of combat and the game. Aard acts as a force and can push enemies back or stun them briefly. Igni stikes with fire, burning them. Yrden slows opponents, making them easier to hit. Quen acts as a shield, protecting you when you need defence. Axii can sway people, stunning them, making them fight for you, calming your horse or persuade people to do what you will. These signs are all very different, working great depending on the situation. Again, the player is needing to play a variety of these tactics in order to defeat the enemy. And some are useful outside combat too, making them more so interesting and fun.

**Upgrades:**

As you level, you get upgrades to purchase as well as mutagens from killing enemies. What makes these special is that the best are not neccesarily at the end, and you can’t use all the ones purchaced at once. This makes you think about the ones you choose and pick ones that work together. Also they are typically not overpowered, still needing multiple attack styles to stand a chance against all opponents.

**Gwent:**

This minigame is pure gold. It is optional, but on getting a deck by playing to win cards, you can play and win this incredible game. It is fun, requires strategy, and can make you more excited to play this than the main game. The addition of this to the main game is a great one, supplementing normal gameplay and giving you a sense of achievement when you win.

**Novigrad:**

Novigrad is incredible, and one of the only two only cities seen in the main game. It is a hallmark of what cities should be in games, putting others like Solitude in Skyrim to shame. It has divisions between rich and poor, a river, and is gigantic, meaning you can complete all the quests there and still be lost. It feels really like a city putting you right into the game as you explore it. You really are in Novigrad - not simply playing a game.

**Quests, Choice and Consequence:**

All the quests are incredible. None are simply grind quests (except maybe scavenger hunts), meaning there is an interwoven story between all of them. More importantly, most side quests have options. You can choose whether to spare or kill the monster. This along with excellent dynamic dialogue means your choices can really change lots of things, and has a real impact on the game. When somebody dies, the chances are it was avoidable. This makes it all the more emotional as you can actually affect the outcome and are therefore potentially at fault.

**Characters:**

The characters are the best thing about this game. In most games, characters are 2D, simply there to fill the world and give you quests. Not here. Each character is excellently described. You actually become friends with them, and feel you are helping them in a situation rather than just getting XP. You spend a lot of time with the characters themselves - in fact in one quest you even spend the night drinking with your fellow Witchers, telling stories and having fun. You’re not simply a cold mercenary - you can experience live in the world just as much. And you build a close relation to them as you spend time alongside them - especially Yennefer and Ciri.

**YOU ARE THE WITCHER:**

Summing up all the limitations on combat and relationships - when playing, most of all, you feel like the Witcher. You do everything he does, you hear him speak as you talk, you grow to learn him as you fight as him. The special thing is you are not yourself. You are watching the story unfold as the Witcher himself. And that is something special. To put yourself in his shoes and be him. That is truely what makes it a good game.
