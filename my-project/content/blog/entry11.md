## Who is Ciri

Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252 or 1253, and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She was the sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.
>Hatred and vengeance blinded me ... But I shall stand before them in humility. I shall remember the expression in their eyes. I hope the memory of those eyes will stop me making a similar mistake.
- Ciri, pg. 463 The Lady of the Lake (U.S. edition)


## Biography

**Ciri** was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year and initially, Calanthe ordered her advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt, wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.


**Growing up**, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, though it appeared Pavetta adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri. However, this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small family was set to sail out from Skellige to Cintra, against Calanthe's wishes, who wished for them all to stay. Shortly after, Pavetta and Duny died at sea around the Sedna Abyss, making Ciri an orphan before she was 5 years old. Angry at her nephew-in-law, Crach an Craite, for letting them sail out, Calanthe then had Crach swear a blood oath that he'd always protect Ciri before deciding to forbid Ciri from visiting the isles again. However, this ban only lasted 6 months before Calanthe let Ciri visit Skellige once more every summer and winter.
