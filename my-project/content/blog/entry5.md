## What is Novigrad

Novigrad is a free city within Redania and is therefore not subject to the rule of that kingdom. It is one of the major ports on the continent and populated by nearly 30,000 inhabitants, making it one of the largest cities in the North.
Like any true metropolis, Novigrad has many factories and is home to all manner of craftsmen offering every ware possible and one can even find the occasional con-man or shady dealer. The city is also home to numerous banks and even has a zoo. The Eternal Fire is said to protect the city's inhabitants from all evil, monsters included. The thick city walls have never been breached, as they were tactfully designed by the architects of the Oxenfurt Academy.

Novigrad is inhabited by an unusually colorful group of both permanent residents and those in town on long and short-term visits. Most eye-catching amidst the throngs of common townsfolk, stall-keepers, and craftsmen are those practicing the more roguish professions. There is no army in the city but it does have a secret service, an ever-present Temple Guard, and a powerful Temple Fleet.

## History

#### First Landing
Before the First Landing, Novigrad was a small elven settlement. When the first human ships arrived in the Pontar Delta, the city was abandoned by the elves and it quickly became the capital of a new country created by King Sambuk, the ancestor of the first king of Redania.

#### Road to independence
During the reign of Vestibor the Proud, Novigrad was conquered by Temeria during the Seven Years' War. The capital of Redania was then moved to Tretogor and Novigrad became a Temerian city for a long period.

 The situation changed during the reign of Vestibor's grandson, Radovid III the Bold. After long negotiations, a compromise was reached and the metropolis was acclaimed as a free city.

#### Northern Wars
After the First Northern War in 1263, King Vizimir II of Redania forced Novigrad into ius stapulae, blocking all merchandise passing the city for inspection and sale within the city.
