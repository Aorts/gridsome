## What is Aretuza

Aretuza is a magical academy for young ladies situated next to the Garstang on Thanedd Island and consists of 5 floors and 76 rooms, including rooms for the students.
Among the students are girls from the twelve finest families in Redania. According to Molnar Giancardi, the annual fees for a student add up to 1,200 Novigradian crowns, with a 200 crown matriculation fee for new students. Adepts studying there are not permitted to leave the island, are forced to abstain from sex, and visitors are only admitted to the lowest level of the academy, Loxia.

## History

In 1267, a reunion of mages was held there but soon devolved into a coup, though many of the students had been moved away beforehand to make room for the visiting mages.

The academy was attacked and destroyed after Radovid declared war on magic in Redania. Some novices escaped beforehand with Margarita Laux-Antille to Novigrad in hope they could escape with Triss's help to Kovir. The students left behind were caught and executed by the Redanian soldiers, only a small handful escaped together with another professor of the academy. By the time Geralt and Yennefer rescued Margarita from prison, all of the novices who accompanied her to Novigrad had been burnt at the stake or executed by other means by the Witch hunters. Margarita was deliberately kept alive by Radovid to be the final execution until Geralt and Yennefer's intervention.
